Pushing and reversing vs shifting: when you shift a number to the front of an array it has to go and move every single number down a slot in order to make that shift happen. Which means the computer has to perform a step for every number in the array. When pushing, the computer only has to perform one step by making a new slot at the end of the array. 

### Speed slide
"n" stands for workload, or the amount of items in an array. Time is in milliseconds. 

Push has a linear time complexity, shift has a quadratic time complexity. 


### Runtime complexity.

Workload normally means the length of the array or list that we're working with, but there are other types of workload. **What are those other types?**

**Sending Data** Plane rate would be constant, cable modem linear

O(n) would be linear time, because the time increases at the same rate as the input
